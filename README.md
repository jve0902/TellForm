Medforms is an opensource *form builder* that can create stunning forms from PDFs or from scratch



## Quickstart

Install dependencies first.
```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

To run development version:
```bash
$ grunt default
```

To run production version:
```bash
$ grunt production
```

Your application should run on port 3000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:

```
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```
$ grunt test:client
```

Currently the live example uses heroku github deployments. The Docker file is out of date and does not work. If someone wishes to get it working feel free to submit a pull request.

## Running in a secure environment
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:
```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```
Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.
