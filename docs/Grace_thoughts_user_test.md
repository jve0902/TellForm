Maybe password hint would be nice, like if you needed a capital letter or number in it
I'm on iOS mobile and the grey title is too big compared to everything else
Home page is not centre aligned
I would use a different background image.. Shows up strange on small screen, thought it was palm trees at first
Cute logo smile emoticon
Also in the "sign in" forgot password doesn't do anything
I haven't gotten the confirmation email yet
