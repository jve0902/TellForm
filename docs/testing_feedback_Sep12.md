	Well first thing I see is that some of the fields are compressed kinda weird on my iPhone (see evan_testing1.jpg)

	And the settings button at the top right is a little hard to make out any of the detail, but that's a pretty minor fix

	When I try to change the title of one of the fields, it bugs out quite a bit too

	Like it seems to be trying to update the info before I've finished typing
